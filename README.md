Veluzity
=======

Veluzity is a iOS and watchOS project published on Apple store. The design was done by my good friend Greg Wilkinson: http://www.gregwilkinsondesign.com/
The project is still in swift 2 and I gave up upgrading. However, I would love to get it up to date and republish it if someone wants to participate please reach out if interested.
